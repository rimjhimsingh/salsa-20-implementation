# Salsa20 Encryption Implementation
This project provides an implementation of the Salsa20 encryption algorithm, as specified by Daniel J. Bernstein. The implementation is written in Python and includes the core hash function, expansion function, and the encryption function of Salsa20.

## Features
Implementation of the Salsa20 quarter round, row round, column round, and double round functions.
Implementation of the Salsa20 expansion function for both 16-byte and 32-byte keys.
Encryption function that takes a key, nonce, and plaintext input to produce the corresponding ciphertext.

## Usage
To use the Salsa20 implementation for encryption, you can follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Use the salsa20 class in your Python code to encrypt data.

## Requirements
Python 3
